BRDF stands for Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function. It is a fundamental concept in computer graphics and physically-based rendering (PBR) that describes how light is reflected at an opaque surface. The BRDF defines the relationship between incoming light and the reflected light at a surface, which is essential for realistic rendering of materials.

Most of the BRDF functions, indirect light approximation and light emission models will be implemented using Shaders written with the GLSL language.

GLSL is a C-like language.

Vulkan require that at least GLSL version is supported. For this reason, a shader source code should start with the #version directive, asking at least for version 4.5.

GLSL uses the column major encoding.
