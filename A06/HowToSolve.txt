Run this shell commands in the A06 folder:

glslangValidator -V shaders/Shader.vert -o ShaderVert.spv
glslangValidator -V shaders/Shader.frag -o ShaderFrag.spv

Once done, you must have two new files in the A06 folder called ShaderVert and ShaderFrag;
drag those files in the shaders directory. Now if you compile and run the code
everything will be allright! The assignment is complete!
